# Wine-Quality-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Predicting wine quality using machine learning techniques. This project explores various algorithms to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties,  aiming to provide insights into factors influencing wine quality. The dataset used contains attributes such as  fixed acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, alcohol and more.

**Overview**
This project focuses on predicting the quality of wines based on various chemical properties using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a dataset from Kaggle, we aim to build a predictive model that can classify wines into different quality categories based on features such as acidity, pH level, alcohol content, and more.

**Dataset**
The dataset utilized for this project is sourced from Kaggle, a platform known for hosting datasets and competitions in data science and machine learning domains.This dataset is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine,along with their associated physicochemical properties and quality ratings provided by experts.

**Methodology**
1.*Data Preprocessing*: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables if any.

2.*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Exploring the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of features, correlations, and identifying patterns that might influence wine quality.

3.*Model Selection*: Used Random Forest model (Machine Learning Model) for classifying the wine quality.

4.*Model Evaluation*: Evaluated the performance of the trained model using appropriate metric , accuracy.
